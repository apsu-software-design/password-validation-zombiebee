# Credit

All credit goes to the University of Wisconsin for the format of this homework assignment and the survey questions below.

# Setup and Review

This repo contains code for the password validator. The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

## Did you find the JavaScript Learning Tutor useful? If so, what about the tool made it useful? If not, why not?
> I am not sure what is meant by 'JavaScript Learning Tutor'. If that means the assignment, then yes, I know a lot more about Javascript and using the cmd now.
If it means something else, then I think I missed it.


## Do you have any suggestions on how the JavaScript Learning Tutor might be improved?
> See above. If not referring to the assignment, then maybe making it easier to find would help.


## Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!).
> My teacher helped a lot with setup. I have not used the cmd much before, so I was lost for a good portion of the beginning of the assignment. I also had never used JavaScript,
so I had to look up the languages general rules along with readline.


## Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
> The coding itself took less than an hour but setting everything up was an ongoing process throughout the week.


## On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment?
> 7


## Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better?
> Maybe an example JavaScript program, so people can get a better idea of the languages rules and structure if they have never seen it before.
